# How to update the inso-nedb fixture

In order to update the inso-nedb fixutre you need to launch Insomnia using the inso-nedb directory. To do this, set the INSOMNIA_DATA_PATH environment variable and launch from the command line.

## MacOS

```bash
INSOMNIA_DATA_PATH=packages/insomnia-smoke-test/fixtures/inso-nedb /Applications/Insomnia.app/Contents/MacOS/Insomnia
```

## Linux

## Windows

After making your changes, be sure to relaunch the app one more time from the command line, so that Insomnia compacts the database. The .gitignore file will explicity ignore certain database files, to keep the directory size down and avoid prevent data leakage in case you are signed in to the app when launching with this database.
